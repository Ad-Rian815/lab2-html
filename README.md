This lab focuses on creating a well-structured HTML5 webpage using semantic elements, implementing an HTML5 form with built-in validation, and ensuring the code meets web standards using the W3C Validator. Students will develop a basic webpage that includes a header, navigation menu, main content area, sidebar, and footer while applying best practices for web accessibility and organization. Additionally, a contact form will be added with required fields and validation rules. The final step involves validating the HTML, fixing errors, and publishing the project to GitHub using version control.
